How did JavaScript expand the functionality of your website?
- It made my page somewhat interactive could've been more interactive if I had the time and patience, but this is the best its going to get.
- It also made my website more appealing


What features are you the most proud of?
- My images & how I was finally able to add a carousel to my cards & also the youtube link eve though it doesn't load


What would you add if you had more time?
- More things the users could interact with like moreee buttons & I would also add more things that would catch a users eye (not sure what)
